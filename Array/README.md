# **Length of a Nested Array :**

# *Suppose we instead wanted to know the total number of non-nested items in the nested array. In the above case, [1, [2, 3]] contains 3 non-nested items, 1, 2 and 3.*

# *Write a function that returns the total number of non-nested items in a nested array.*

## *getLength([1, [2, 3]]) ➞ 3*

## *getLength([1, [2, [3, 4]]]) ➞ 4*

## *getLength([1, [2, [3, [4, [5, 6]]]]]) ➞ 6*

## *getLength([1, [2], 1, [2], 1]) ➞ 5*
